File: /User/frank/Objc_Classes/ProcessedSound
This directory contains objects which can be used for processing speech data.  The following objects are contained in this directory:
	
1. NISTPhonemeMap:  An object useful for labeling phonemes from the TIMIT data 
   base.

2. NISTSound: A subclass of ProcessedSound, it adds the capability of
   processing NIST .wav files.

3. NoisySound: A subclass of NISTSound, it adds the capability of adding noise
   to the speech prior to processing.

4. ProcessedSound: An object which reads in NeXT .snd files, and processes
   them to get cepstral coefficients, LPC analysis, etc.

5. SpeechProcessor: An object which takes raw speech, and does processing to
   obtain spectral and time domain features.  ProcessedSound has an instance
   of SpeechProcessor in order to do its work.

6. TiDigitInput: An object which facilitates the job of reading in processed
   sound files from the TI Digit data base.
